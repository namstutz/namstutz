# Welcome!

I am a recent Tech Elevator bootcamp graduate looking to start a career in software development.

My GitHub use to date has been primarily for my work with [TicketNut](https://ticketnut.com/).

My Tech Elevator capstone project, the Family Reading Tracker, is live! It's a full-stack app built with Java Spring Boot and a Vue.js front end. The backend is currently hosted on [fly.io](https://fly.io).

Users can set up a family, add their books to track reading progress, and set goals for reading activity in the form of prizes to achieve.

...I do have one other public project on GitHub. Tech Elevator held a small competition to build an

**[âœ¨ Ugly Website âœ¨](https://namstutz.github.io/Ugly_Website/index.html)**

I built this in three days of spare time and won first place! However, it is not a representation of my skills or design taste or really anything I want to be associated with. It still exists as proof that I can put a web page on the Internet.
