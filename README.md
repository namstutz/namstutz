# Welcome!

I am a recent Tech Elevator bootcamp graduate looking to start a career in software development.

I haven't added any of my Tech Elevator work or side projects to this repository yet, but stay tuned!

**[✨ Ugly Website ✨](https://namstutz.github.io/Ugly_Website/index.html)**
I built this in three days of spare time and won first place! However, it is not a representation of my skills or design taste or really anything I want to be associated with. It still exists as proof that I can put a web page on the Internet.
