# Welcome!

I am a Digital Communications Specialist working on the Web Team for [The MetroHealth System](https://www.metrohealth.org). I use Sitecore to publish various bits of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

My GitHub use to date has been primarily for my work with [TicketNut](https://ticketnut.com/), building a ticket and event platform using Ruby on Rails.

I am a Tech Elevator graduate, May 2023 NLR cohort! My Tech Elevator team capstone project, the Family Reading Tracker, is a full-stack app built with Java Spring Boot and a Vue.js front end.

Users can set up a family, add their books to track reading progress, and set goals for reading activity in the form of prizes to achieve.

...I do have one other public project on GitHub. Tech Elevator held a small competition to build an

**[âœ¨ Ugly Website âœ¨](https://namstutz.github.io/Ugly_Website/index.html)**

I built this in three days of spare time and won first place! However, it is not a representation of my skills or design taste or really anything I want to be associated with. It still exists as proof that I can put a web page on the Internet.
